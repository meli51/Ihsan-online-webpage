Every hour of your life that passes cannot be replaced. Do away with whatever you can of distractions and obstacles which prevent you from striving your utmost to attain knowledge.  and similarly it is said that knowledge will not give you a part of it until you give it your all.</p></div>

</h3></div>


          <div><p>Knowledge cannot be gained only from books; you must also have a shaykh whom you trust to open the door to knowledge and keep you from making mistakes. So you must have good manners towards him, for this is the way to success, learning and strength. So you must honour, respect and be polite to the shaykh. Observe the utmost standards of etiquette when you sit with your shaykh and speak with him.

    But those who have patience and perseverance attain the heights of the glory that they desired.
    
    Do not think that attaining glory is as easy as eating dates;
    
    You cannot attain glory until you swallow the bitterest medicine.”
    
    So be patient and persevere. If jihaad requires an hour of patience, then the seeker of knowledge must be patient until the end of his life. </p></div>
